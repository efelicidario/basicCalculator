### Background
A button-driven basic calculator GUI that can handle simple operations. Created in C# on Visual Studio

### Functionality
- 0-9 numpad
- Basic operators (+, -, x, ÷)
- An equals button (=)
- A visual text output of the calculation

Must display the results of calculation after pressing the “=” button, and follow the order of operations 
as a typical calculator would – that is, typing 2 + 4 x 2 is equivalent to (2 + 4) x 2, which equals 12.
Any additional features and functionality are welcomed!
